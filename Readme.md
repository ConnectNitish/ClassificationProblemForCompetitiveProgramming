<h1>Project Number : 35</h1>
Group Name: Classifiers<br />
Team #: 1 <br />

Multilabel classification is an important paradigm in machine learning. <br />
In this project we have scrapped coding websites like CodeChef , Codeforces ; and come up with our own set of features to label         programming problems. After this we are predicting tags based on problem statement and solution of problems. 


<h2>Objectives:</h2> 

	Collection of data from coding sites like Codeforces, Codechef etc.
	Classify questions based on the tags.
	Classify based on problem text and solutions.

<h2>Workflow</h2>

	Data Collection
	Data Pre Processing
	Exploratory Data Analysis
	Implementation : 
		Linear Support Vector Classification and visualization(s)
		Long Short Term Memory and visualization(s)
	Comparison of Approaches


<h3>Implementation Approaches:</h3>

	Prediction using LSTM model
	Prediction using Linear SVC

<h3>Web Scraping technologies to use:</h3>

	BeautifulSoup python
